<h2 style="color:black;"> Interests </h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="\\buffalo.cs.fiu.edu\homes\Desktop\16Districts_1[1].jpg">Running</a></li>




When I was in middle school, my brother and I made a bet. He bet that I couldn't run 3 laps around my house for the entire summer. I proved him wrong and ended up enjoying myself at the end. I have participated in my school's Cross Country and Track&Field team since freshman year.</p>

<h2 style="color:black;"> Bucket List </h2>

<ol>
	<li> Own and rent out banana boats at the beach.</li>
	<p id="demo" style="display:none"> When I took a trip to the Bahamas, I discovered that I wanted to own and rent out banana boats for a living. The old man who inspired me said he lived life with "No stress man!"...He made me think about how much I worry about the little things in life. I fear that most people don't look at the world around them and enjoy the scenery. For this reason, my dream is to help others learn to relax and have fun.</p>

</ol>

<h2 style="color:black;"> Project</h2>
<p>In this digital age, computer programs have all but infiltrated every aspect of our lives. Through GirlsWhoCode, I learned how important coding is to society and developed an appreciation for the amount of time and effort put into every project in an attempt to serve the community. I was bale to make a game inspired by One Piece.
